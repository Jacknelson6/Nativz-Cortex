  "category": "ui-ux",
  "description": "Enable clicking the entire mood board block/node to open the details/analysis side panel, not just the Details button. Must not conflict with drag behavior on the React Flow canvas.",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Clicking a mood board block opens the side panel",
    "Details button still works independently",
    "Click does not conflict with drag behavior",
    "Consistent with board-style UX patterns"

    {
      "step": 1,
      "description": "Add click handler to block node",
      "details": "In the React Flow custom node component, add an onClick handler that opens the selected item's side panel. Set the selected item ID in state.",
      "pass": false
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "description": "Differentiate click from drag",
      "details": "Use React Flow's onNodeClick callback (fires only for clicks, not drags). Alternatively, track mousedown/mouseup position delta to distinguish click from drag.",
      "pass": false
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "description": "Ensure Details button still works",
      "details": "The Details button's onClick should stopPropagation to prevent double-triggering. Both paths should open the same side panel.",

  "estimatedComplexity": "medium",
  "technicalNotes": [
    "React Flow provides onNodeClick which only fires for actual clicks (not drag start)",
    "Side panel is likely the analysis panel component in the moodboard page"
